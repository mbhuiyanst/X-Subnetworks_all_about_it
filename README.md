# X-Subnetworks and power control for Interference Management_all_about_it
Here I will write step by step about X-Subnetworks definition, why it is necessary and some use cases..........


X-Subnetworks:
The lastest surge in wireless communication marks the transition from the Internet of Things (IoT)
to the Internet of Everything (IoE), where objects, processes, and people interconnect.The aspiration to achive Internet of Everything(IoE)
necessities a trnasition to the 6th Generation Network as the capabilities of the 5th generation network are insufficient to meet the stringent 
demands envisioned for the IoE. Specifically, 5G falls short in providing the requisite higher reliability, lower latencies, 
and increased data rates crucial for IoE applications.

A promising solution to address these extreme requirements is the concept of in-X subnetworks, where "X" denotes an entity such as vehicles, robots,
or the human body. The term "subnetwork" signifies that these network cells can connect to the 6G network while also being capable of 
independent operation when outside the coverage area of the wider network. This autonomy is vital as in-X subnetworks are expected to support life-critical functions,
necessitating uninterrupted connectivity even in challenging environments.

Overall, in-X subnetworks represent a pivotal development in wireless communication, offering the potential to meet the demanding requirements 
of the Internet of Everything era while ensuring reliability and resilience in critical applications.

How can we deploy or design X-Subnetworks?
In-X subnetwork models serve as frameworks for networks composed of subnetworks, each comprising
a control unit along with multiple sensors and actuators. These subnetworks operate within the higher frequency 
bands typically ranging between 6 to 10 GHz. The operational dynamics of in-X subnetworks involve sensors transmitting data to the control unit,
which then processes this data and sends commands to the actuators for appropriate action.

Why in X-Subnetworks is necessary?
The overarching objective of in-X subnetworks is to meet stringent requirements, including ultra-reliable 
low-latency communication with latencies below 0.1 ms and a packet error rate on the order of 10^-6 to 10^-9 .

Some use cases of in X-Subnetworks:
Automotive Applications: In the automotive sector, in-X subnetworks are anticipated to support functions
such as autonomous driving, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and collision avoidance systems.
Requirements include ultra-low latency, high reliability, and seamless mobility.

Industrial IoT (IIoT): In industrial environments, in-X subnetworks enable real-time monitoring, 
predictive maintenance, and process optimization. Requirements entail robustness, scalability,
and compatibility with industrial protocols and standards.

Healthcare and Wearables: In healthcare applications, in-X subnetworks support remote patient monitoring, 
medical device integration, and personalized healthcare delivery.
Requirements include stringent security, privacy safeguards, and compatibility with medical regulations.
